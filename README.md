1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving with the integration of advanced technologies 
such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). These technologies offer 
significant potential to improve patient care, enhance diagnostic accuracy, and streamline 
administrative processes. MedInsight is designed to leverage these advancements to create 
a comprehensive, user-friendly, and efficient healthcare management system. 
1.2 Objectives 
The primary objective of the MedInsight project is to develop a web-based healthcare 
solution that assists patients in identifying potential diseases based on their symptoms while 
providing essential medical guidance. Additionally, the system aims to facilitate efficient 
patient-doctor management through an administrative dashboard. 
2. Project Overview
